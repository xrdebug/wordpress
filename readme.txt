Debug WordPress with xrDebug.

== Description ==

[xrDebug](https://xrdebug.com) is an Open Source lightweight debug utility.

After installing this plugin, you can use the `xr()` function to quickly dump stuff. It provides several [debug helpers](https://github.com/xrdebug/php?tab=readme-ov-file#debug-helpers) and also the `wp_xri()` inspector function which you can use to retrieve WordPress context-aware information.

Here some examples:

`
xr('Hello world');

xr(['a' => 1, 'b' => 2], e: 'ðŸ”´');

xr('multiple', 'arguments', 'are', 'welcome');

xri()->pause();

wp_xri()->showQueries();
`

Note: To debug using this plugin make sure to set `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` to a value different than `production`.

`
define( 'WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE', 'local' );
`
